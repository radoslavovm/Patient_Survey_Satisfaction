"Very professional office Visit was streamlined "
Very quick and efficient.
My experience with Advanced Radiology over the years has been positive. Seems to be a well run company. I can't say that about a lot of companies these days.
"The staff members are incredibly sweet and courteous. The friendliness at this establishment is amazing! I love going there and mammograms aren’t exactly what people enjoy going to but this place helps make it a better more positive experience "
"I was very satisfied with the service I received! "
It is a pleasure to be under your care.  Very good experience
"Staff was very kind, caring with my disability."
"All the technicians and Dr at this facility always make a very unnerving experience a breeze. "
"Tami was friendly  and compassionate. "
Great experience. Love the evening hours. The receptionist and technologist were extremely friendly.
"I have done the mammogram/ultrasound before. This staff was very respectful and kind. There was very little wait in the process. Staff listened to my concerns and addressed any questions I had. "
I didn’t know when the mri scanning was starting - would have been good to know that from the technologist
everyone was very nice and knowledgable
"Very pleasant experience "
"My procedure was very good and the staff was wonderful "
"quick and efficient visit, really fine visit"
Very happy with the service and the wait time was very good.
"Compare to Griffin breast center this place is not patient center. Feels like you are just a number. There’s no room to place your things as it was so busy so had to walk around with personal items. I wish I had different insurance and I could go back to Griffin. Unfortunately the health care we live in Is dictated by insurance not patient’s preference "
Great Team
"My technician, Kelsey, was so kind and understanding of my anxiety. She sought to give me my results as soon as she could. Such a caring human being."
"Getting these types of scans is a stressful experience at times, but Advanced Radiology’s professionalism, expertise and kindness with patients puts your mind at ease!"
They are very friendly
"Directions to the facility were confusing. "
Ty
Everyone was very helpful and friendly. They all made the visit pretty easy.
I first went to the Shelton office but was told the equipment was not working so I was forced to travel to the Stratford office.  It was an inconvenience for me but I was accommodated as a walk in.
Very considerat
"Everyone is very professional, warm and welcoming. I always feel very well taken care of when I'm there. "
"Because I wasn't experiencing a problem, I had to wait from August to December for the appt. I was coming once a year because of dense breasts. That was my only complaint."
"The scheduling woman is very professional and kind.  Friendly staff at check-in.  Technician Tim is quick and efficient. Tim even noticed I may have an umbilical hernia and he suggested I get that checked. Great team. "
"It took weeks and several phone calls to be able to schedule an appointment. I never experienced this before.  I was given different explanations from different people. I also was not pleased that radiologist tried to speak with me from hallway when I was sitting in gown in the dressing room. Very different from my last experience where I got dressed and went to a room to meet with radiologist-I felt that she did not have time for me, which was disconcerting. "
Friendly and sensitive to my needs
The one thing I didn't like is that I had to digitally sign the treatment agreement without being able to read it first. She could give me a copy only after I had signed.  Not a good practice. I like to see what I'm signing beforehand.
Thank you.
"I had 2 incidents at my mammogram which were surprising and not up to the usual level of excellence at Advanced Radiology.  The first was that when I was shown to a dressing room, there was a robe and package wrapper left there from the previous patient.  The technician took them away but it was still a little off-putting because every patient likes to think that they're getting a fresh, clean dressing room.  The second was that when I was being set up for the first picture, the machine was set too high.  I am short (5 ft) and have very large breasts and I actually said ""Ow"" loudly and told her it was too high when she tried to lift up my breast to where the plate was.  I told  her the machine had to be lowered, which she did.  All of the other times I've had mammograms the technician can see that I'm short and they lower the machine before we get started."
"Yes, you should tell patients how long the procedure will last and have a count down timer to let them know when it will end. I did not hear the technicians voice when it ended. Also if technician talked to me while the test was happening it would have been more comforting."
"Your entrance to building from parking lot  on Corporate Drive is terrible. I walk to the awning that says Advanced Radiology only to find that I must go to the entrance that says Medical Arts  .  How is that clear??  What if I were handicapped, or it was bad  weather. Have you not noticed this??   "
the staff was very friendly....
"The staff and technician were very friendly and professional.   The technician made sure I was comfortable during the testing.  "
"The cleanliness wasn’t at prior levels.  The mammogram machine, that your face is forced to press up against smelled like an old lady’s armpit…. i was really disgusted… not ok.  Should be sterilized between patients! "
Was a very easy and stress free experience
"I have had several recent appointments with Advanced Radiology.  Every time I am asked to fill out the same questionnaire.  It is redundant and waste of time. "
The bathroom that patients use could use some attention……otherwise a very good experience!
"Dawn was great! "
Excellent Experience
"Very friendly and professional "
"Thank you for taking such good care of me. I find comfort that I have such an amazing team to assist me "
"As first patient on a Sunday morning, I was surprised to see requests to acknowledge my arrival before the office even opened. "
"The ladies that helped me were kind, were aware of my needs and helped me though the exam. "
"Very accommodating and gentle. Very sensitive to my emotions. Thank you Karen in Wilton/Fairfield,CT."
"They were all friendly,  attentive and great"
The tech who administered my CT scan was outstanding!  I did not even feel it when she put the needle in for the contrast.  I really appreciated that. Overall an excellent experience.
"They were very professional and polite and patient "
"The tech could not have been nicer and put me at ease. "
"Very professional staff and compassionate and caring. "
"Liliana Reyes is a keeper, made me relax and helped relieve my anxieties with her charm and her professional demeanor.  "
"Everyone was helpful, patient and kind"
"unable to obtain a clear MRI. Needed to reschedule at a different location. "
"I waited longer than I hoped to with no timeframe provided "
Kelsey is a skilled technician. I'm grateful for her good work in being thorough and detecting abnormalities.
"Over all very good experience from entering the building till I left "
"Great team, very professional and my scheduled appointments were right on time."
The technician was awesome.....very attentive and caring.....
Need new x-ray table that can adjust to height. Very difficult to maneuver on n off.
"Riley was exceptional She put me at ease and was very knowledgeable "
Appreciate the kindness and professional attitudes
"Nice, efficient workforce."
"Great technician "
I was a walk in and the technician was very considerate and fit me in.  I was so happy not to have to come back another day
"Very efficient and courteous personnel "
I had to wait almost one month for a cncelled appointment
"Excellent customer service "
"I went to the Stratford office and there was two technicians Danielle and Jody and they made me feel so comfortable. I don’t usually do reviews but they were amazing. They calm me right down because I was worried about a little panic attack with my MRI. If all your employees are like them, you have a winning team thank you Danielle and Jody "
I hate these satisfaction reports. It reminds me of being just a number. Thank God the staff knows how to treat a client.
I was surprised at the speed in which everything was accomplished.
"the technician who did my mammogram (Rachel) was lovely. Kind and clear. But the woman who did my ultrasound (she never offered her name?) was quite the opposite. Gruff. Not especially kind. And not a great communicator.  The whole experience left me incredibly uneasy and frankly, in tears."
"Very professional with caring attitude. A pleasant atmosphere. "
"Very efficient process with very nice personnel.  The technicians are excellent.  I give your operation an A+!!! "
"My technician, who I unfortunately can not remember her name was excellent. I wish I got her every time. She talked with me, put me at ease and did a great job at sticking me, I hardly felt anything .Very patient. I absolutely feel she is in the right field of helping people. This is not to take away from anyone else because they are all good but she was exceptional. I’m a believer of acknowledging good people. That’s why I would always recommend going to this office in Shelton."
"The service from the front desk right through to the CT scan was warm, friendly, and competent."
"Advanced Radiology made me feel so comfortable and at ease. Their level of knowledge is unmatched and rewarding. Thanks for your professionalism and care. "
I thank you so much for your excellent care.  Elaine Greenwald
"Important to share that when I was checking in there was also a woman checking in for her 1st mammogram.  The woman behind the desk was speaking loudly to co worker about an issue w/ the womans insurance & she was irritated & did not care.  The co worker attempted to whisper but the other did not catch on.  The irritated womans "
The lady who too my X-Rays was one of the nicest and most efficient technician had in quite a while.
"Staff were thoughtful, making my MRI a pleasant experience.  Thank you."
Thought that Wendi who did my ultra sound was very pleasant.  She apologized for running late.
"nice team, easy check in. my only complaint is that the waiting room is a little chilly. but thank you for the service!"
"Very kind "
"I came in for three separate tests, one after the other.  ALL staff were friendly at 7AM when I started and the MRI technician was especially comforting by keeping me informed of the testing progress."
"When I called for an appointment, I was advised that with a paper prescription I would have to go as a walk-in. The woman who answered the phone went ahead and checked the schedule without me asking and told me that afternoon was a good time to go. I was taken within five minutes of arriving. I can’t tell you how nice it is to have people on the phone and then in person be so helpful. What a pleasant experience compared to the endless round of prompts on phone calls these days and many times leaving you frustrated without an answer.  "
"Advanced Radiology in Trumbull is the most efficient and organized medical office I have seen in a very long time. My experience was so pleasurable with a test I had put off for a while. I will not hesitate next year to use this office again. Thank you. "
Excellent experience in every way. Everyone at Advanced Radiology goes out of the way to do the very best they can to make the patient feel comfortable. Thank you.
"Pauline went above and beyond. She’s the sweetest person I’ve met there. "
Very helpful and curtious
"I  waited over 15 minutes after changing into robe in a small cubby. During that time I received a text from Hartford Health asking if I had arrived yet? Obviously I had already checked in with your receptionist. I had to ask gal who escorted me in, what was up, as everyone else in my section was long gone. She said a tech would be coming for me soon. After another 5 minute, tech came. No apologies for lateness and not much bedside manner. Very disappointed as this facility usually runs like clockwork which is why I choose to come here. Hopefully it was just an off day!   "
I went for a mammogram and ultrasound waited 6 months for an appointment .Mammogram technologist was sweet did great job.I was scheduled for ultrasound too because my mom had breast cancer at 38 and died at 46 because it came back.I have dense breast tissue have had it since I was 16 .I been having pain in left breast .The ultrasound technician called me ask me why I was there.Said the radiologist said my breast were not dense.Which was strange to me because I have always been told they were dense .Said insurance might not cover my ultrasound because my breast are not dense so she can’t put that down .I get home read mammogram results and it in fact says I have dense breast tissue in spots.So frustrating I really hope they didn’t miss anything by not doing an ultrasound.Especially since it took 6 months for my appointment.I guess I will leave it in gods hands.The front staff is great and have never had a problem with advanced radiology before.I think they are just over booked and I got the wrath of it .
Took a bit for me to get scheduled but finally got an appointment.  Iris at check in is amazing - super professional and kind
Always a pleasure seeing your staff.
I had to cancel my appointment a few months back and it did take me three-three months to get another available appointment. I guess you were very backed up.
