# Patient_Survey_Satisfaction
How do we get the most out of survey responses? 

Using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#sentiment-analysis) to provide a polarity score for every text comment a patient leaves. 

TextBlob.py 
    Functions involved in taking in a Patient Satisfaction Survey table, and creating a new table with the Survey ID and the polarity of each sentence.

Connection.py 
    Here we establish a connection to the database. 
    You will need a JSON file with the database credentials to be able to run this program
